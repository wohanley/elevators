An interactive look scheduler. Click on a panel to create a request, and it
will be serviced... eventually.

There are also implementations of other algorithms in elevators/queue,
particularly FIFO, shortest seek, and scan, and it would be easy enough to swap
them out if you wanted to see what those look like.

You can build it yourself with SBT (I use 0.13), or use the jar.
